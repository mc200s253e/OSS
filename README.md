Glasgow School of Art - IxD year 2, "Control" project


"We have intercepted an inter-spatial (video) transmission from an unknown planetary system.
We called this system MC 20,0°S 25,3°E."


The OSS controller is a VJ controller with effects. It controls the opacity of 4 video streams (3 pre-recorded movie and a live webcam) and allows the user to apply 9 different effects to the sum of the videos.
